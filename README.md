# Mythos Hunter

**There are no official builds yet, unfortunately.**

Game will feature:

    - several regions, based on Egypt, Asia, Scandinavia, Slav culture, south america, indians, etc.
    - RPG part will mean that with each level our skills in hunting increase (like tracking, sneaking, combat, crafting, trap setting, etc.)
    - monsters will need to be lured to come out of hiding, where you can then hunt them (traps can weaken them, apply debuffs, etc.)
    - different regions will require different equipment (e.g. warm clothing for winter regions, light clothing & additional water for hot/tropical regions, etc.)
    - new monsters will be tracked by our tracker friend.
    - before embarking on the hunt, you can research the monster (what it needs to be lured out, what it is weak to, etc.)
    - after killing the monster you will receive trophies (and maybe some additional powerful components based on how much you prepared for/researched the monster)
    - you will gain access to skill trees that improve your hunting & combat abilities
